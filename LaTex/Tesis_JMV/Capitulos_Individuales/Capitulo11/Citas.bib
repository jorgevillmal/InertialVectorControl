	abstract = {ABSTRACT It has been presented in previous works that every uniformly observable single-output system can be put on a triangular observation form. For this structure a special kind of sliding mode observer has been designed by authors, which ensures a finite-time state reconstruction using a step by step observation algorithm. In this paper, we show that the multi-output case is more delicate to study especially when the system has some unknown inputs. Thus, in order to generalizes the triangular observer form, from single to multi-output case, we define an Implicit Triangular Observer (ITO) form. For such a form, two results are given. Firstly, we design a finite time converging observer for all values of the unknown inputs. Secondly, we give the necessary and sufficient condition, including a matching condition, for the existence of a coordinate change to put the system into this form. It is also shown that this class of systems is a subset of the uniform observable class of systems.},

The proposed high-order sliding-mode observer provides a finite-time converging estimate of the continuous system’s state vector in spite of the presence of unknown inputs. The design procedure, which assumes knowledge of the discrete state of the switched system, is based on the principles of disturbance decoupling and hierarchical observer output injection. In order to cope with the switching nature of the plant under observation, jumps in the observer state space are enforced intentionally. The implementation of an additional observer allows for the reconstruction of the unknown inputs, which may be important in the framework of fault detection. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested technique."

OFC leads to strong interactions with loads and aeroelasticity and consequently must be detected in time. This paper proposes a hybrid unknown input observer for robust and early detection of such unauthorized oscillatory events. The technique has been developed during ADDSAFE project. The monitoring strategy is associated with the decision making rules as currently used for in-service Airbus A380 airplane. The observer has two subsystems operating in continuous and in discrete time. The continuous part is based on a high-order sliding-mode differentiator. The discrete part is used to solve on-line a nonlinear equation using a gradient descent method. Robustness and performance of the proposed fault detection scheme are tested using a high fidelity benchmark and intensive Monte Carlo simulations based on several flight scenarios as specified in ADDSAFE project. The performance indicators of the proposed scheme are measured by its detection delay, its propensity to issue false alarms and whether it permits a failure to go undetected."

It is shown that there are two different concepts of strong detectability, which coincide for discrete-time systems. Algebraic conditions for either concept are given. It is shown that these concepts are intimately related to the existence of strong observers, i.e. observers that only use the output of the plant."

The basic idea is to decompose the system in a nonlinear part, that can be transformed into a nonlinear observer form, and a perturbation term connected in the feedback loop. In transformed coordinates the observer error becomes linear with a feedback perturbation. By using the dissipativity theory it is possible to design the observer gains so, that the closed loop is internally stable if some LMIlike conditions are satisfied. This method is very flexible and allows the design of nonlinear observers using exact linearization methods to a much bigger class of systems. The method is shown to be very general, since it includes (and generalizes) as special cases several observer design methods, as for example the exact error linearization method, the high-gain method, the circle criterion design method, and the design for Lipschitz nonlinear systems. The design is computationally simple in many cases, since it reduces to the solution of a feasibility LMI problem, for which highly efficient numerical methods are available. The method offers great flexibility in the design, since the particular properties of the nonlinearities can be characterized by means of one or several quadratic forms, i.e. supply rates. This feature can be used to design observers for systems with special properties in the nonlinearities.",

	abstract="Lyapunov functions are a basic tool for analysis and design in the modern control theory, and there are many different design methodologies based on Lyapunov theory. Second Order Sliding Modes, and in particular, the Super-Twisting Algorithm (STA), are a powerful tool for the design of controllers, observers and differentiators having very attractive dynamic features: they converge in finite time, even in presence of persistently acting bounded perturbations. This property, that we will call exactness, can be achieved because of the discontinuous nature of the STA. The design of control or observation algorithms based on Second Order Sliding Modes has been performed until now using either geometric or homogeneous approaches, but not Lyapunov methods. The reason for this situation is simple: only recently has been possible to find adequate Lyapunov functions for some of these algorithms. In this paper some recent advances in this direction will be presented and extended.",

However, for nonlinear systems this study is usually a very hard task, in particular, when unknown inputs and/or perturbations are present.

	abstract="For systems with relative degree two we propose a homogeneous controller capable of tracking a smooth but unknown reference signal, despite of a Lipschitz continuous perturbation, and by means of a continuous control signal. The proposed control scheme consists of two terms: (i) a continuous and homogeneous state feedback, and (ii) a discontinuous integral term. The state feedback term aims at stabilizing (in finite time) the closed loop while the (discontinuous) integral term estimates the perturbation and the unknown reference signal in finite time and provides for perfect compensation in closed loop. By adding a continuous and homogeneous observer we complete an output feedback scheme, when not all states are available for measurement. The global finite time stability of the closed loop and its insensitivity with respect to matched Lipschitz continuous perturbations is proved in detail using a smooth and homogeneous Lyapunov function.",

In order to consider passivity of the error dynamics for the observer problem, we place a conceptual input and output on the generalized error dynamics which also includes the plant, and the strictness of passivity is extended with respect to a set in which the estimation error becomes zero. Then, output feedback passivation for the error dynamics will lead to the construction of a state observer. It is also shown that a nonlinear observer is generally vulnerable to measurement disturbance, in the sense that even an arbitrarily small measurement disturbance can lead to a blowup of the error state. However, due to the passivity of the error dynamics, the proposed nonlinear injection gain can be easily modified for the observer to be robust to measurement disturbances."

	abstract="The first part of this two-part paper presents a general theory of dissipative dynamical systems. The mathematical model used is a state space model and dissipativeness is defined in terms of an inequality involving the storage function and the supply function. It is shown that the storage function satisfies an a priori inequality: it is bounded from below by the available storage and from above by the required supply. The available storage is the amount of internal storage which may be recovered from the system and the required supply is the amount of supply which has to be delivered to the system in order to transfer it from the state of minimum storage to a given state. These functions are themselves possible storage functions, i.e., they satisfy the dissipation inequality. Moreover, since the class of possible storage functions forms a convex set, there is thus a continuum of possible storage functions ranging from its lower bound, the available storage, to its upper bound, the required supply. The paper then considers interconnected systems. It is shown that dissipative systems which are interconnected via a neutral interconnection constraint define a new dissipative dynamical system and that the sum of the storage functions of the individual subsystems is a storage function for the interconnected system. The stability of dissipative systems is then investigated and it is shown that a point in the state space where the storage function attains a local minimum defines a stable equilibrium and that the storage function is a Lyapunov function for this equilibrium. These results are then applied to several examples. These concepts and results will be applied to linear dynamical systems with quadratic supply rates in the second part of this paper.",

A necessary and sufficient frequency domain condition for dissipativeness is derived. This is followed by the evaluation of the available storage and the required supply and of a time-domain criterion for dissipativeness involving certain matrix inequalities. The quadratic storage functions and the dissipation functions are then examined. The discussion then turns to reciprocal systems and it is shown that external reciprocity and dissipativeness imply the existence of a state space realization which is also internally reciprocal and dissipative. The paper proceeds with an examination of reversible systems and of relaxation systems. In particular, it is shown how a unique internal storage function may be defined for relaxation systems.

For a special class of uncertainty, a fault reconstruction scheme is presented where the reconstructed signal can approximate the fault signal to any accuracy. The proposed fault estimation/reconstruction signals are only based on the available plant input/ouput information and can be calculated on-line.
