	abstract = {ABSTRACT It has been presented in previous works that every uniformly observable single-output system can be put on a triangular observation form. For this structure a special kind of sliding mode observer has been designed by authors, which ensures a finite-time state reconstruction using a step by step observation algorithm. In this paper, we show that the multi-output case is more delicate to study especially when the system has some unknown inputs. Thus, in order to generalizes the triangular observer form, from single to multi-output case, we define an Implicit Triangular Observer (ITO) form. For such a form, two results are given. Firstly, we design a finite time converging observer for all values of the unknown inputs. Secondly, we give the necessary and sufficient condition, including a matching condition, for the existence of a coordinate change to put the system into this form. It is also shown that this class of systems is a subset of the uniform observable class of systems.},

abstract = { The concept of strong detectability and its relation with the concept of invariant zeros is reviewed. For strongly detectable systems (which includes the strongly observable systems), it is proposed a hierarchical design of a robust observer whose trajectories converge to those of the original state vector. Furthermore, it is shown that neither left invertibility is a sufficient condition nor strong detectability is a necessary condition to estimate the unknown inputs. It is shown that the necessary and sufficient condition for estimating the unknown inputs is that the set of the invariant zeros that do not belong to the set of unobservable modes be within the interior of the left half plane of the complex space. This shows that the unknown inputs could be estimated even if it is impossible to estimate the entire state vector of the system. Two numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation schemes. }

	Given a (differentiable) signal it is an important task for many applications to estimate on line its derivatives. Some well known algorithms to solve this problem include the (continuous) high-gain observers and (discontinuous) Levant’s exact differentiators. In this work we present a family of homogeneous differentiators, encompassing these two algorithms, and we propose a unified smooth Lyapunov function, that allows a common framework to study their convergence and performance analysis.}

The proposed differentiator provides for proportionality of the maximal differentiation error to the square root of the maximal deviation of the measured input signal from the base signal. Such an order of the differentiation error is shown to be the best possible one when the only information known on the base signal is an upper bound for Lipschitz’s constant of the derivative."

abstract = {It is shown that a general uncertain single-input–single-output regulation problem is solvable only by means of discontinuous control laws, giving rise to the so-called high-order sliding modes. The homogeneity properties of the corresponding controllers yield a number of practically important features. In particular, finite-time convergence is proved, and asymptotic accuracy is calculated in a very general way in the presence of input noises, discrete measurements and switching delays. A robust homogeneous differentiator is included in the control structure thus yielding robust output-feedback controllers with finite-time convergence. It is demonstrated that homogeneity features significantly simplify the design and investigation of a new family of high-order sliding-mode controllers. Finally, simulation results are presented.}

	abstract="In this paper a method to design observers for nonlinear systems is proposed. The basic idea is to decompose the system in a nonlinear part, that can be transformed into a nonlinear observer form, and a perturbation term connected in the feedback loop. In transformed coordinates the observer error becomes linear with a feedback perturbation. By using the dissipativity theory it is possible to design the observer gains so, that the closed loop is internally stable if some LMIlike conditions are satisfied. This method is very flexible and allows the design of nonlinear observers using exact linearization methods to a much bigger class of systems. The method is shown to be very general, since it includes (and generalizes) as special cases several observer design methods, as for example the exact error linearization method, the high-gain method, the circle criterion design method, and the design for Lipschitz nonlinear systems. The design is computationally simple in many cases, since it reduces to the solution of a feasibility LMI problem, for which highly efficient numerical methods are available. The method offers great flexibility in the design, since the particular properties of the nonlinearities can be characterized by means of one or several quadratic forms, i.e. supply rates. This feature can be used to design observers for systems with special properties in the nonlinearities.",

	abstract="Lyapunov functions are a basic tool for analysis and design in the modern control theory, and there are many different design methodologies based on Lyapunov theory. Second Order Sliding Modes, and in particular, the Super-Twisting Algorithm (STA), are a powerful tool for the design of controllers, observers and differentiators having very attractive dynamic features: they converge in finite time, even in presence of persistently acting bounded perturbations. This property, that we will call exactness, can be achieved because of the discontinuous nature of the STA. The design of control or observation algorithms based on Second Order Sliding Modes has been performed until now using either geometric or homogeneous approaches, but not Lyapunov methods. The reason for this situation is simple: only recently has been possible to find adequate Lyapunov functions for some of these algorithms. In this paper some recent advances in this direction will be presented and extended.",

However, for nonlinear systems this study is usually a very hard task, in particular, when unknown inputs and/or perturbations are present.

The proposed control scheme consists of two terms: (i) a continuous and homogeneous state feedback, and (ii) a discontinuous integral term. The state feedback term aims at stabilizing (in finite time) the closed loop while the (discontinuous) integral term estimates the perturbation and the unknown reference signal in finite time and provides for perfect compensation in closed loop. By adding a continuous and homogeneous observer we complete an output feedback scheme, when not all states are available for measurement. The global finite time stability of the closed loop and its insensitivity with respect to matched Lipschitz continuous perturbations is proved in detail using a smooth and homogeneous Lyapunov function.",

A fault estimation approach is presented to estimate the fault and the estimation error is dependent on the bounds on the uncertainty. For a special class of uncertainty, a fault reconstruction scheme is presented where the reconstructed signal can approximate the fault signal to any accuracy. The proposed fault estimation/reconstruction signals are only based on the available plant input/ouput information and can be calculated on-line. Finally, a simulation study on a robotic arm system is presented to show the effectiveness of the scheme."
